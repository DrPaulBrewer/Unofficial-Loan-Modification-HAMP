<h2>Steps for HAMP calculations</h2>
These steps explain what the Unofficial HAMP Calculator is supposed to do. When you push the "click to calculate" button, these steps guide the animation of the intermediate results listed as Outputs. The intermediate calculations continue, using each step in order, until the monthly payment reaches the affordability goal. The first version of the waterfall procedure had fewer steps -- but these steps have been kept in later versions -- see  <a target=_blank href="./documents/SpecialDirective0901.pdf" >US Treasury Supplemental Directive 09-01: Introduction of the Home Affordable Modification Program</a>, pages 8-10. Later rule changes added the steps for principal reduction and lender's variation, and then HAMP Tier 2. See <a target=_blank href="./documents/mhahandbook33.pdf" >The MHA Handbook v3.3</a> and <a target=_blank href="./documents/mhahandbook40.pdf">The MHA Handbook v4.0</a>
<ol>
<li><em>Capitalize accrued interest and certain costs. To do this, make sure the unpaid balance includes all unpaid interest and other fees that can be assessed against this loan.  Do not include late fees in the unpaid balance. </em></li>
<li><em>Reduce principal, if principal reduction is offered.  This is a new step, part of the "principal reduction alternative".</em></li>
<li><em>Convert ARM loans to fixed rate, fully amortizing loans. Reduce the interest rate from the current rate by 0.125% drops to as low as 2.0% to try to reach the target monthly payment level.  Do not round the initial rate to fit a 0.125% grid. If the resulting rate is below the Freddie Mac 30 YR rate then bump up the interest rate 1.0%/year after year 5 until that rate is reached.  If the resulting rate is higher than the 30YR then keep the rate steady where it is.  </em> 
</li>
<li><em>If necessary, extend the term and recalculate as up to a 480 month (40 year) loan </em>
</li>
<li><em>As if things weren't complicated or tedious enough already, if the principal was reduced by 5% or more the lender is allowed to reverse the order of the reduce rate and term extension steps.  The lender can increase the time to pay to 40 years BEFORE reducing the rate.  </em></li>
<li>
<em>If necessary, provide for non interest-bearing principal forebearance to achieve the target monthly mortgage payment ratio, i.e. a non-interest bearing balloon payment. Under the MHA 4.0 documentation, the suggested maximum limit for principal forebearance is the maximum of 30% of the unpaid balance or the amount needed to achieve 100% LTV (i.e. unpaid balance - market value) and is reduced by any initial principal reduction.</em>
</li>
<li>Finally: Try Tier 2, a new formula -- if the Tier 1 modification fails </li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<h3>What is HAMP Tier 1 and Tier 2?</h3>
<p><b>NEW</b> Tier 2 is a new calculation for those who fail Tier 1, and was rolled out in 2012. Both Tier 1 and Tier 2 are still in use. Borrowers who do not qualify for  Tier 1, or who defaulted on Tier 1, are evaluated for Tier 2 which is a similar but different formula.  Tier 2 operates as follows:  the interest rate is the FRM 30 YR AVG rate for the entire loan, the loan is lengthened to 40 years, and there would be either a principal forgiveness or a balloon. There are fewer adjustable or optional components to the formula, no "search", no dozens of small steps. The mathematics is less sensitive to income. The payments may also be a higher percentage of income in Tier 2. A Tier 2 modification is not indicated if the modified monthly payment does not fit in the target monthly payment window (this is tested here in the unofficial calculator) or if it is not at least 10% lower than the current loan payment (this is currently untested in the unofficial calculator). The NPV test can still veto a Tier 2 modification.</p>
<h3>In some cases, do HAMP's rates and payments increase after 5 years?</h3>
<p>Yes, and the calculator tries to calculate this effect. It is a step in the HAMP directive and it has been programmed into the unofficial calculator. Page 9 "Step 2" of Directive 09-01 requires rates that are sufficiently low to rise after 5 years. The rate, of course, affects the payment.  Rates rise when they are below the Freddie Mac 30 YR rate that was in effect when the loan modification agreement was prepared. Thats why the current Freddie Mac 30 YR rate is shown and then asked for in the Inputs section of the unofficial calculator. </p>
<h3>NPV or Net Present Value -- A final step that can veto the loan mod</h3>
<p>Although in some cases the modifications suggested by the Treasury program descriptions look quite good for the distressed homeowners, they may also be bad for the lender. Modifications do <em>not</em> have to be made if computer modelling shows the lender could realize more money through foreclosure or foreclosure alternatives like cash-for-keys.</p>
<p>The calculation lenders make to evaluate the value of the modified loan is called an "NPV test" or Net Present Value, a method of converting the future values -- the promises a homeowner makes in the modified loan -- into present value, or money now.  A homeowner who wants to keep the home generally would want/hope the NPV of the modified loan is more than the amount the lender could realize in money now through forcing a sale of the home. </p>
<p>At this time, an independent "unofficial" approach to this NPV calculation is beyond the scope of this website. But you can use a free calculator recently released by the government. </p>
<p> Treasury and HUD have announced a public calculator for this NPV at <a href="https://checkmynpv.com">https://CheckMyNPV.com</a>.  </p>  
<p> Also, <a target=_blank href="http://www.sigtarp.gov">SIGTARP (Special Inspector General for Troubled Asset Relief Programs)</a> has issued a <a target=_blank href="./documents/sigtarp_npv_report.pdf">public document entitled "The Net Present Value Test's Impact On The Home Affordable Modification Program"</a>. The "Conclusions"/"risk premium" subsection on p.16-17 has some interesting details about how some of the major HAMP servicers adjusted a variable related to risk in the NPV test (including BofA, Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase, Fannie/Freddie) and its effect on eligibility...  Whether you support or are opposed to the idea of helping distressed homeowners, it makes for some interesting reading.  
</p>
<h3>Loan Mod Hell</h3>
<p>It has been reported that some banks repeated asked applicants for the same information over and over again.  There have also been reports of dual tracking of foreclosures alongside modifications, so that when the modification is finally denied the foreclosure will follow shortly thereafter. One hopes these practices will be curtailed (there may be a law in California going into effect Jan 2013). Search for "loan mod hell" or "dual tracking" at google or youTube for more information. </p>
