<h2>Steps described in Treasury Supplemental Directive 09-01 for implementing HAMP</h2>
<ol>
<li><em>Capitalize accrued interest and certain costs. To do this, make sure the unpaid balance includes all unpaid interest and other fees that can be assessed against this loan.  Interestingly, late fees are not to be included in the unpaid balance when making the calculations. (So what happens to the late fees?) </em></li>
<li><em>Convert ARM loans to fixed rate, fully amortizing loans. Reduce the interest rate from the current rate by 0.125% drops to as low as 2.0% to try to reach the target monthly payment level.  If the resulting rate is below the Freddie Mac 30 YR rate then bump up the interest rate 1.0%/year after year 5 until that rate is reached.  If the resulting rate is higher than the 30YR then keep the rate steady where it is.  </em> 
</li>
<li><em>If necessary, extend the term and recalculate as up to a 480 month (40 year) loan </em>
</li>
<li>
<em>If necessary, provide for non interest-bearing principal forebearance to achieve the target monthly mortgage payment ratio, i.e. a non-interest bearing balloon payment. </em>
</li>

<p>Although in some cases the modifications suggested by the Treasury program descriptions look quite good for the distressed homeowners, they may also be bad for the lender. Modifications do <em>not</em> have to be made if computer modelling shows the lender could realize more money through foreclosure or foreclosure alternatives like cash-for-keys.</p>
