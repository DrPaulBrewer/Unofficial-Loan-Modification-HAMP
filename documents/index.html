The Reading Room

<p>Below are some government policy documents we reviewed. 

<p>Although these documents are intended for policy and financial specialists,
portions will be comprehensible to most people.  If you have a degree
in finance, economics, or business, you may be able to follow some of the
math and procedures in these documents, at least the basic stuff.  

<p>Keep in mind that government policy is constantly subject to change and so part or all of these policies may be out of date.   

<p>You may need an Adobe PDF viewer to view the documents.

<p>It is our understanding that US government policy documents are NOT subject to  copyright.  We have provided these copies to support the "guesses" that our calculator makes and for your further educational and reading pleasure.
